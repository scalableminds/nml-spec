## Purpose
NML files are used to represent skeletons in 3D data. Skeletons are described 
using trees with nodes and edges. Furthermore the NML file definition allows to
store information about the underlying dataset. 

## Changes
Feel free to suggest improvements to the file format. The best way is to create 
a pull request changing the XSD and example files. After that the pull request can 
be used as a base for discussion.
